    <h2>Approach to engineers</h2>
    <ol id ="work_info">
        <li>Work matching your desired career</li>

        We have a firm grasp of the engineer's desired career and work to be able to engage in work that matches the career as much as possible.

        <li>Work in a team system</li>

        We have created a system where we can work with members of the same company as much as possible so that it is easy for them to consult with each other.

        <li>You can choose how to work</li>

        Engineers can choose the following way of working according to their own lifestyle, and in principle, we have a system that allows us to change the way of working once a year.

        <ol>
        <li>Full-time employees (constant-time employment), contract employees (fixed-term employment)</li>
        <li>Freelance</li>
        <li>A mix of full-time or contract employees and freelancers</li>
        </ol>
        <div class ="little">※You may need certain conditions to change the way you work.</div>
            

        <li>Housing consultation / introduction possible</li>

        The partnership with a real estate company that has built a trust relationship makes it possible to consult / introduce housing.
        
        <li>Visa consultation / procedure request available</li>
        The company is a member of the Immigration Association (public interest incorporated foundation), and can receive professional counseling and various applications to the Immigration Bureau for status of stay, qualification change, permanent residence application, etc.
        
    </ol>
